# Reddit-Comment-Score-Prediction
Reddit is a social news platform that allows users to discuss and vote on content that other users have submitted.On an average reddit receives 470,000 comments per day. The comments are further upvoted or downvoted by the registered users.   Imagine you are going to start a forum where users can post or comment or share content on the platform. Now you want to filter out some positive comments and recommend them to your users.     Build a machine learning model that will help you know which comment or content is going to be popular in the near future (the content which receives the highest upvotes will be popular) and accordingly recommend such content to your users.
